# Solutions to Privacy-Focused Email Agent Issues

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. FolderNavigationManager Type Resolution Issues

**Problem:**
- Java was unable to resolve the `FolderNavigationManager` class in multiple files:
  - In `App.java`, line 198
  - In `UIManagerFactory.java`, lines 147 and 152
  - In `MainApplication.java`, line 234

**Solution:**
- Used fully qualified class names `com.privacyemail.ui.FolderNavigationManager` instead of relying on imports
- Updated method signatures in `UIManagerFactory` to explicitly use the fully qualified return type
- Updated creation code in `App.java` and `MainApplication.java` to use the fully qualified type

### 2. Automatic Authentication Not Working

**Problem:**
- The application was not automatically checking authentication status on startup
- The `postInitialize()` method was defined in `MainWindowController` but not being called

**Solution:**
- Added explicit call to `controller.postInitialize()` in `App.java` after initializing all UI managers
- This ensures that the controller is fully initialized with all dependencies before attempting authentication

### 3. Backend Connectivity Issues

**Problem:**
- The frontend was unable to connect to the backend service running on port 5000
- Connection attempts were failing with `java.net.ConnectException`

**Solution:**
- Created a README.md with clear instructions on how to start both components in the correct order:
  1. Start the backend server first: `cd backend && python -m backend.main`
  2. Start the frontend application: `cd frontend && mvn javafx:run`
- Added troubleshooting guidance for connection and authentication issues

## Verification

- Compilation errors have been resolved, and the application now compiles successfully
- The frontend application starts without errors
- When the backend is running, the frontend should be able to connect and perform authentication checks

## Next Steps

1. Start the backend service before running the frontend
2. Follow the authentication flow by clicking the "Login" button
3. Test email retrieval functionality after successful authentication
